                One of the most wondrous and terrible properties of Kindred vitae is its ability to enslave nearly any being who drinks of it three times. 
                Each sip of a particular Kindred's blood gives the Kindred in question a greater emotional hold over the drinker. If a being drinks three times, 
                on three separate nights, from the same Kindred, she falls victim to a state known as the blood bond. A vampire who holds a blood bond over another being is
                said to be that victim's regnant, while the being subordinate to the bond is called the thrall.

            <p>
                Put simply, the blood bond is one of the most potent emotional sensations known. A blood-bound victim is absolutely devoted to her regnant and will do nearly anything for him. 
                Even the most potent uses of Dominate cannot overcome the thrall's feelings for her regnant; only true love stands a chance against the bond, and even that is not a sure thing.

                The blood bond is most commonly used to ensnare mortals and ghouls, but Kindred can bind each other as well. 
                Such is the blood bond's power that a mighty elder can be bound to a lowly neonate; in this respect, the blood of a Thirteenth-Generation fledgling is (presumably) 
                as strong as that of Caine himself.
            </p>
            <p>
                A full blood bond, once formed, is nearly inviolate. Once bound, a thrall is under the sway of her regnant and her regnant only. 
                She cannot be bound again by another vampire unless the first blood bond wears away “naturally.” 
                A vampire can experience lesser (one- and two-drink) bonds toward several individuals; indeed, many Kindred enjoy such bonds, 
                as they create artificial passion in their dead hearts. Upon the formation of a full blood bond, though, all lesser sensations are wiped away.

            <p>
                Vampire lovers occasionally enter into mutual blood bonds with each other; this is the closest thing the undead can feel to true love. 
                Even this sensation can turn to disgust or hate over the centuries.
