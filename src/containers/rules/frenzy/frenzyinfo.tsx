                During a frenzy, a character literally — and usually unwillingly — gives into the darkest instincts of the vampiric nature. 
                The character is consumed with rage or hunger, unable or unwilling to consider the effects of any action. 
                Friends, foes, lovers, ethics: None of these things matter to a vampire in frenzy.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a vampire in frenzy is hungry, he will feed from whoever is closest without regard for the vessel's well-being. If the vampire is angry, 
                he will do everything in his power to destroy the cause of his anger. A vampire struck by fear will commit any atrocity to remove himself from the source of his terror, 
                regardless of the consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
                The character completely surrenders to the basest aspects of his Nature, shunting aside the Demeanor most commonly presented to those around him. 
                He is, in short, the Beast.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Camarilla, succumbing to frenzy is seen as weakness, a humiliating loss of control.  
                Vampires who frenzy often, and especially in public, run the risk of social rejection or worse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though many among the Camarilla Kindred are monsters through and through, the laws of the Masquerade and simple civility require that the Beast be kept in check; 
                those who cannot do so are not vampires, but animals, and should be put down for the good of all. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A frenzy can be induced by many things, but great rage or hunger are the most common provocations. It is dangerous to deny or humiliate the undead. 
                For this reason, vampires of the Camarilla commonly veil slights and threats in webs of double-talk and subtlety, lest they suddenly trigger an outburst in Elysium.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the Storyteller can call for a vampire to make a frenzy roll at any time, whenever he feels the character might have cause to lose control.
