            <h3>Final Death</h3>
            <p>If a vampire is at the Incapacitated health level or in torpor and takes one more level of <b><i>aggravated damage</i></b>, he dies permanently.</p>
            <p>This means a player in torpor must be torched, bitten or slashed by supernatural claws/fangs, take sunlight damage or other forms of aggravated damage to permanently die.</p>
            <p>
                Normal bashing or lethal damage does nothing to a vampire in torpor, unless the damage is massive: 
                Decapitation, being trapped under a 10-ton rock, fed into a wood chipper, caught in an explosion, 
                crushed by deep-sea pressure or similar extreme damage will cause final death for vampires.
            </p>
