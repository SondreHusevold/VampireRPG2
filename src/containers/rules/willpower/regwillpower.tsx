            <h2>Gaining Willpower</h2>
            <p>
                Willpower may be recovered as well as spent. 
                The following situations earn the character back a point or more of Willpower, though a character’s Willpower pool may never exceed her Willpower rating.
            </p>
            <p>The only way to increase a character’s Willpower rating is through experience-point expenditure.</p>
            <p>Generally, a character’s Willpower pool may be replenished whenever the character fulfills a goal or has an opportunity to restore her self-confidence</p>
            <p>Ultimately, specific instances of Willpower restoration are up to the Storyteller. </p>
            
            <h3>Each Night</h3>
            <p>Characters regain one Willpower point each night when they first rise.</p>
            
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>If a character attains some extraordinary goal or fulfills an outstanding objective, the Storyteller may reward her with a point of Willpower. </p>
            <p>For example, if a character manages to deter a team of vampire-hunters from her sire’s haven, the Storyteller may award a Willpower point to that character.</p>
            
            <h3>Nature</h3>
            <p>If a character behaves in a manner that fulfills her Nature Archetype, the Storyteller may reward the character with one to three Willpower points (as stated in the Archetype descriptions).</p>
            <p>For example, if a Rebel character rabidly opposes a powerful elder, and that elder is later revealed to be a Sabbat spy, that character may be given a point of Willpower.</p>

            <h3>End of a story</h3>
            <p>
                Characters’ Willpower pools replenish fully at the end of a given story (and that’s story, not session).
                The Storyteller may restrict this by requiring that the characters achieve (or partially achieve) a goal or otherwise boost their self-esteem.
